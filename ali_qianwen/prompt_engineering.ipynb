So, I sought out additional training and resources, and also made sure to prioritize my tasks and set realistic goals for myself. With hard work and dedication, I was eventually able to improve my skills and become more confident in my abilities.\\nInterviewer: Thank you for sharing that experience with us. Finally, do you have any advice for individuals who are just starting their careers in this field?\\n[Your name]: Yes, I would advise anyone starting out in this field to be willing to learn and adapt quickly.
